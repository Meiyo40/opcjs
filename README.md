Study project for the 3rd OpenClassRoom DWJ Path

Objectives:
-Build a single page/application for making a reservation for a bike (Velib/Cyclenville)
-Use Javascript, no plugin for the carousel/signature pad.
-No backend (PHP, Nodejs or other..)
-Must use the JCDecaux API with AJAX.
-Must use a free API for the map (here leaflet)
-Must use the API Web Storage

Even if we can use JQuery/Bootstrap (or other), I'll try to do it in "vanilla" for learning purpose.
